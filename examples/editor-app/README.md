# UJL Editor App

The **UJL Editor App** is a demonstration application for the Unified JSON Layout (UJL) Framework. It serves as an example of how to integrate the UJL packages `crafter` and `core` into a cohesive editor interface.

## Purpose
The Editor App provides:
- An environment to **create, edit, and preview UJL-based layouts**.
- Integration of the **Crafter** package to allow configuration of UJL modules.
- A reference implementation for developers building similar applications using the UJL Framework.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Editor**: Modify and test UJL layouts in real time.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built on UJL packages to ensure scalability and flexibility.
- **TailwindCSS Styling**: Uses utility-first CSS for a responsive and customizable design.

## Note
This package is intended as a developer example and is not meant for production use. Developers can adapt it to their specific needs when implementing their own UJL-based solutions.
